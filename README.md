# bluesky-sms-service
This program utilizes [SignalWire APIs](https://developer.signalwire.com/technical-reference/) as well as [Bluesky's atproto API](https://atproto.com/docs) to host a simple Python application in Google Cloud, utilizing best practices for securing credentials when possible. 

## To use!
Simply text `register <your bsky.social handle> <your bsky.social app password>` to `+1 414-432-4321`. To register an app password, you can do so [here](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords). Note that you will *not* receive any messages back from this number, due to increasingly strict anti-spam laws. 

After you've registered, you can text that number any time you want to post to Bluesky! Photos via MMS are supported as well! 

Let me know if you run into issues, you can raise an issue here or contact me via [Bluesky here](https://bsky.app/profile/assf.art)
